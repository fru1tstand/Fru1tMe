			<h1>www.Fru1t.Me & *.Fru1t.Me Privacy Policy</h1>
			<div>Hi. Kodlee here from Fru1tMe/KodleeShare. Much like you I am a
				human being. I don't like it when companies sell my data to other
				companies and stuff. I also hate ads. So I'll try to keep this
				privacy policy short and sweet.</div>

			<div>This privacy policy covers the domain "fru1t.me" as well as all
				sub domains of "fru1t.me" including but not limited to
				"homework.fru1t.me". This privacy policy applies solely to the
				information collected by this website.</div>

			<h2>Registration</h2>
			<div>In order to use certain applications on this website, a user
				must either register or login with a login service. During
				registration, a user is never required to give personally
				identifying information. We also do not extract or store personally
				identifying information from the login services we use. The sole
				purpose of having a login system on our site is to be able to
				distinguish between users so that your saved data stays with you. We
				may ask for your name or a nickname to call you so that your
				experience with our applications may be more personalized, but
				again, this is not required.</div>

			<h2>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h2>
			<div>This site only saves the data you explicitly give it. We are the
				sole owners of this data and thusly, we will never sell, rent, or
				share your data to anyone. We only ask you for your name, which is
				completely optional (you can even throw a fake name in there if you
				want), during registration for presentational purposes within our
				web applications. We ask that you do not give us any other
				personally identifying information for security purposes (as we
				neither use it, nor need it). We will never email you because we
				hate spam as much as you do (and our server is a little email-shy).</div>

			<h2>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h2>
			<div>Any and all information you give us can be added to, changed, or
				deleted at your discretion. We strive to provide you with 100%
				control of your information. We also try to provide ways for you to
				see all the data we have stored from you (however I can’t guarantee
				my 4am programming sessions won’t forgot something once in a while).</div>

			<h2>Security</h2>
			<div>We take precautions to protect all of your information. That
				doesn’t mean we super-secure SSL to encrypt your precious homework
				assignments; however, we do try our best to secure our server from
				attacks and malware.</div>

			<h2>Cookies</h2>
			<div>We use “cookies” on this site. A cookie is a piece of data
				stored on a site visitor’s hard drive to help us improve your access
				to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance,
				when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a
				password every single visit (because we remember you!). Cookies are
				never used to track your interests or your computer habits or
				whenever you go to the bathroom. We use cookies for good, not evil.
				Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable
				information on our site. Not like we have any anyway.</div>

			<h2>Data Sharing / 3rd Party Applications</h2>
			<div>HAH! Nope. None of that.</div>

			<h2>Links</h2>
			<div>We have links to other websites on this website. This is what
				makes the internet go ‘round. We claim no responsibility for the
				content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage users
				to be aware when they leave our site and read the privacy statements
				of any other site.</div>

			<h2>Updates</h2>
			<div>Our privacy policy may change from time to time to accomodate
				our apps, and we will be sure to let you know when we do via
				announcements on the applications. All updates will be posted on
				this page.</div>
