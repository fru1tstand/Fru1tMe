			<div>Please don't sue me :( I'm just a poor college student trying to
				make a name for himself. A lot of this is some legal jargon I copied
				and pasted from some other site. But in all honesty, it's saying
				that this site is not guaranteed to work 100% of the time and that
				when it doesn't work, I'm not responsible for what happens. Please
				read!</div>
